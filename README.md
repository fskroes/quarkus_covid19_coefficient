# covid-19-coefficient Project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.
This project calculates the coefficient between death cases that are vaccinated of a given population.
The source data of Covid-19 cases are https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Covid-19-API.

## Endpoints
Replace the inside of {} with your preference.
``` 
GET /coefficient/all                      --> returns the calculated coefficient for all countries
GET /coefficient?continent={Europe}       --> returns the calculated coefficient for a given continent
```

Note this application gives an estimate on a calculated coefficient between 
the people that died from Covid-19 and got vaccinated. But given the data source
is getting more and more outdated, the ratio of it is as well. The people that died and got vaccinated is not available.





## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/covid-19-coefficient-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
